Grape may be very picky: too cold, too hot, too dry, too wet..., and so on without an end. The winemaker, who serves the vine, leaves a part of his soul in it. Otherwise, nothing will come of it.<br><br>That's why there are so many different wines, with different aromas and tastes, that will give you very different states of mind. Professional sommeliers will tell you all about the origin of the wine, its physical properties, and so on. This is the initial stage of understanding the drink. It is possible to memorize the features of different soils, the slightest influence of weather conditions, and aspects of winemaking. Still, it won’t be enough to comprehend the wine because we do not take into account its creator, the winemaker.<br></p>

It will be easier to understand if you are familiar with <a href="https://www.jovianarchive.com" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Human Design</a> theory. According to it, each person has a unique nature (Design), which is supposed to be manifested in their life. Deviation from one's personality breeds sickness and unhappiness. At the same time, people and society influence us from birth; they educate us = they condition us. A child and any immature person perceive this conditioning as part of themselves, which is false. This becomes obvious as we grow up. The primary task of every human being is deconditioning, a return to the origins of the Design. At the same time, we cannot live in a vacuum and are doomed to be conditioned by someone or something to understand someone and work together as a society. The trick is to do so with understanding and without losing yourself. That is what wine is about.<br><br>Choosing the right wine is like training conscious conditioning. It is impossible to know what energies every place on our Earth carries; it’s impossible to know what thoughts and Design the winemaker had to choose the right wine for you as accurately and logically as possible. That’s why I use intuition to select the right wine. I call it the "dive into the bottle" method.<br></p>

Then scan the bottles you see in front of you without paying attention to the labels. Place your attention inside a bottle of wine, and try to understand how you feel there. Is everything fine? Is this the desired state? If yes, the wine is right for you. No? Then continue scanning the bottles. As each wine reflects someone's life and destiny, you may find yourself trying it on and relating to it. Thus, wine cannot be consumed thoughtlessly. Then you may start paying attention to the labels and see your patterns of choice: countries, grape varieties, etc. I love Portuguese wines. They have the broadest spectrum of psycho-emotional states you may want to experience. The next in line is Italy. French wines are predominantly about the three lower chakras.</div><div><br></div><div>The colors of wine may guide you in your choice:</div><div>• white wines treat the states of mind</div><div>• red wines treat the body.</div><div><br></div><div>Sugar levels in wine are also something to consider when choosing your drink — the bitter you feel, the sweeter the wine, and the less you need.</div></h5>
