                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Scotland and Ireland traditionally disputed the right to be called the homeland of whiskey. The history of the beginning of whiskey production is lost in the depths of centuries, and these two countries always argue about who was the first to produce the very first bottle.<br>By the way, the disagreements on the origin of an amber drink are so strong that the Scots and Irish even write the word "whiskey" differently — in the Scottish style, it is "whisky,” while the Irish write "whiskey.” Both unanimously declare that these are fundamentally different things, although pronounced similarly.<br>Anyway, Irish whiskey became known worldwide much earlier than Scottish whisky. While the proud Scots, who constantly fought the British, took a circular defense in their mountains, where, among other things, they produced and then drank their whisky themselves, the Irish not only produced but also sold their whiskey to the British, and they, in turn, resold it all over the world. This made Irish whiskey so widespread.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Whiskey is a high-status drink. Having become popular in the British Isles, it was banned at some point for sale to peasants and any other not noble people. There is logic in it because, as you will find out in this chapter, the essence of whiskey is about Personal Power. The aristocracy would not have appreciated the mob gaining access to their sacral energies and enforcing their wishes.<br><br>Whiskey is loved by people who are strongly at odds with their life force. When a person does not understand their motives and desires, whiskey is an obvious choice if they do not know how to use their life force.<br><br>Since we are talking about the ability to handle one's life force, Nature should be our role model. It offers abundance, not overproduction or shortage. Each element is in its place, doing what it was born for; there is no lack of resources or energy for growth and fulfilling its destiny.<br>Energy, the life force, is granted to get work done — this is Nature's law. The structure of modern society is built on manipulative tricks of power acquisition. Money was invented to start the processes of interchange, communication, creativity, and creation among immature people. While in Nature, there is a feeling and understanding of the measure of everything, and cooperation between everyone is established.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Whiskey reflects this problem within each drinker. Let us now talk about the essence of the drink. The aspect of life force in whiskey is represented by malt, a newly sprouted grain. It gives us a sense of someone who does not yet know themself and has not manifested themself into a mature being. Oak barrels are the aspect of society in the drink.<br><br>You may also find these cereals in the description of <a href="vodka.html" class="text-primary">vodka</a>:<br>	•	<strong>Wheat</strong> (<em>Triticum aestivum</em>) brings a theme of discord between parents and children, emotional instability, low motivation, concentration and memory, and self-doubt. This is a child who cannot rely on his parents.<br>	•	<strong>Rye</strong> (<em>Secale cereale</em>) discord in the family due to infidelity and a broken heart.<br><br>And also, these are used in whiskey:<br>	•	<strong>Barley</strong> (<em>Hordeum vulgare</em>) represents someone seen as a jester, lacks love, and feels lost.<br>	•	<strong>Corn</strong> (Z<em>ea mays</em>) represents domestic tyrants who liken themselves to God, conceit, and misunderstanding; corn is also about a subconscious need to be in harmony with Nature. American bourbon whiskey is made predominantly from corn.<br><br>Drinking whiskey is justified when you have an idea of what to do in your life, but for some reason, your energy is too weak, and you do not know how to overcome it without consuming alcohol.<br><br>Drinking whiskey just for the fun of it is more like masturbation. For example, the superb Jameson whiskey can release a lot of energy. But here comes a question "What next? What are you going to use all that energy for?" So, before diving into the bottle, there is much to consider.<br></p>
